# Neural-Numeric-To-Text-Generation

As the data used to create these models requires permission from the Singaporean Management University, the data will not be provided. 

There are two main scripts:
 - ED.py (CNN-LSTM and Transformer-LSTM)
 - ED_transformer.py (Transformer-Transformer)

Once data is provided, run inout_to_csv.py to generate sequence data for the models, including the summaries.
